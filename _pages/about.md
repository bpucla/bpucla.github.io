I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at UCLA, advised by Prof. [Ying Nian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/research.html). 

My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in generative modeling, representational learning, and unsupervised learning, and their applications in computer vision, natural language modeling.
